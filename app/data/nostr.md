# **Likes and views are great, but how about earning some money?**

If you're someone who values your time and effort, you might be curious about the buzz surrounding the new NOSTR web and how everyone is getting paid on it. So, what exactly is NOSTR?

### **What is NOSTR?**

NOSTR is revolutionizing the way we interact online. It offers content creators, curators, and even commenters with an easy way to earn real bitcoin for their contributions, while simplifying the content-sharing process. NOSTR is a communication protocol that enables modern social media apps to provide users with a seamless multi-app experience, where content only needs to be posted once to be viewed anywhere.

Say goodbye to the hassle of updating profiles and reposting content across multiple accounts, managing various comment sections, and juggling multiple inboxes. NOSTR unifies everything, allowing you to switch between different apps without losing followers or posts. The best part? The bitcoin rewards incentivize higher quality content, transforming social media into an unparalleled experience where a casual poster can evolve into an article author or a meme maker into a marketing guru.

### **How do I connect to NOSTR?**

For a quick start with NOSTR try [Alby](https://getalby.com/invited-by/orangemart). 
 1) Open the [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). 
 2) Add-on the [Alby browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/alby/).
 3) Set a passcode for unlocking.  
 4) Connect your [Alby account](https://getalby.com/invited-by/orangemart) or connect your own wallet.

You're ready to start! Alby has generated a NOSTR identity for you. If you've used NOSTR before, you might already have an identity. To continue using it, simply import the identity's private key (npriv) into the browser extension.

Here's how:

1. Go to wallet settings -> key management -> NOSTR settings.
2. Choose to delete, keep, or import your npriv.

You can install the extension on multiple devices, such as your desktop, laptop, and mobile. After installing, check the NOSTR settings to ensure you're using the same identity across all devices. You could also install mobile nostr apps like [Amethyst](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitorpamplona.amethyst&hl=en&gl=US), [Primal](https://primal.net) & [Damus](https://damus.io/).

## **Where do I begin with NOSTR?**

### **1. Set Up Your NOSTR Profile.** 

- **Open a NOSTR Client**: Start by opening a NOSTR client in your browser, such as [noStrudel](https://nostrudel.ninja), and log in using your browser extension.
- **Edit Your Profile**: Navigate to your profile and find the edit button. Here, you can input your Display Name, Profile Picture, Bio, and add your lightning address. 
- **Lightning Address**: If you're using an Alby account, your lightning address can be found in the browser extension (e.g. orangemart@getalby.com). Alternative lightning address providers include [Blink](https://blink.sv), [Coinos](https://coinos.io), [WoS](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com), [ZBD](https://zbd.gg) and [more](https://lightningaddress.com/). If you run your own node then your address could be yourname@yourdomain.

### **2. Make Your First Post.**

In this step, we'll use a different NOSTR web client, such as [Snort](https://snort.social).

1. **Sign In**: Sign in with your browser extension.
2. **Profile Information**: You'll notice that all the profile information you updated in the previous step with the other client is already set up here. This seamless transfer of information is one of the advantages of using NOSTR.
3. **Make Your First Post**: Let's make our first post using Snort.
4. **Switch Clients**: After posting, switch to another NOSTR client to view your post. This exercise will help you understand how to navigate and interact with the new web.

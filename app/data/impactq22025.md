## ‚ö° Impact

Across three Rust servers ‚Äî **Orange**, **Mandarin**, and **Tangerine** ‚Äî we‚Äôve integrated sats directly into the survival grind.

Players **earn Bitcoin** by staying alive, building communities, and proving their worth through in-game activity.  By measuring real-time **proof of work** through Rust‚Äôs native scrap economy, we reward players for **time, skill, and teamwork**.

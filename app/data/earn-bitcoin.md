Do you have what it takes to earn Bitcoin playing Rust? Here's Orange Mart's guide to earning
Bitcoin in Orange.

## Unleash the Hunt: Find Blood in Locked Crates

Blood can be found in locked crates on the Orange server and traded in for Bitcoin at the Blood
Bank.

- Utilise the map (press G) to identify locked crates, which will be clearly marked when available.
- Keep an eye out for these crates in high-risk locations such as the cargoship and oil rigs.
- Upon activation, a locked crate will require 15 minutes to open.
- Secure the blood then head over to the Blood Bank to trade it in for Bitcoin. Conveniently, you
  can choose between an in-person visit or use a drone from the Outpost or Bandit Camp.
- Sound easy? Give it a shot.

## Trade for Progress: Offer Goods or Services for Bitcoin

Want to earn some Bitcoin without hunting for blood? Try offering a good or service to others in
Orange

- Secure in-person trades can be conducted using the shop front window.
- Utilize the vending machine for offline and long-distance trading. Ensure that the area in front
  of the vending machine is clear, allowing drones to access it.
- Unleash your creativity by advertising your goods and services in the global chat and utilizing
  billboards strategically placed around Orange.

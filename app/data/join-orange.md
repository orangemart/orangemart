  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/" target="_blank"> Steam website </a>
- Search for "Rust" in the Steam Store. You can find the Rust page by clicking
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/252490/" target="_blank"> here.</a>
- Purchase Rust for $40 to obtain a lifetime license. The purchase will grant you access to the game
  and future updates for free. There may be occassional sales so keep an eye out for a discount.

## Search for Orange in the modded category

To find the Orange server in the modded category of Rust, perform the following steps:

- Launch Rust from the Steam library.
- In the game's main menu, select "Play Game."
- Choose the "Modded" option.
- In the search bar, type "Orange" to filter the server list.
- Make sure to check the boxes labeled "Show Full" and "Show Empty" to display all servers,
  regardless of their current player count.
- When you find the Orange server, add it to your favourites to easily access it in the future.
- Join the Orange server to start playing!

Alternatively, you can open the console by pressing F1 while in Rust and directly connect to the
server by typing the following command:

```
client.connect 64.40.8.29:28066
```
